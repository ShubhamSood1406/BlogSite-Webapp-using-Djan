# BlogSite-Webapp-using-Django

BlogExpress is an web-application based on Django framework where a user can upload their blogs.
I used HTML with Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network) to designing the web page and use Bootstrap's nav-bar for navigation bar and Bootstrap's modal for login and add blog pop up so that user can login and add content of blog.

VErsion 2.0 of this Project is here: https://github.com/ShubhamSood1406/Django-Blog-v2

### Login 
User click on Login button to Login with their Username and Password and Django will authenticate the user.
