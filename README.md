# BlogSite-Webapp-using-Django

BlogExpress is an web-application based on Django framework where a user can upload their blogs.
I used HTML with Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network) to designing the web page and use Bootstrap's nav-bar for navigation bar and Bootstrap's modal for login and add blog pop up so that user can login and add content of blog.

### Login 
User click on Login button to Login with their Username and Password and Django will authenticate the user.

### Home Page
After login to the web-app user will see their name on the top left corner of the navigation-bar with option of "Add Blog"

When user click on Add Blog then a modal pop-up in which user can enter Title and Content of the Blog.
